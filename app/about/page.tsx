            Formula SAE is an international competition hosted by the Society of
            Automotive Engineers (SAE). This Collegiate Design Series (CDS)
            competition pushes students to go beyond classroom material by
            challenging them to design, build, and test the performance of a
            formula-style vehicle. Each vehicle is inspected in a series of
            tests to comply with all competition rules to ensure safety.
            Students are tested and scored on their knowledge of their vehicle
            design by experts in various industries and cars are tested on
            numerous tracks including acceleration, autocross, endurance, and
            skid pad.
