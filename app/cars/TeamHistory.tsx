        description: `Due to funding limitations, we reused the same chassis for 2022 and made some major improvements to the car. We were still feeling the aftermath of COVID this year with mostly new members. Of the 22 people we had at comp, only 4 of them had gone to a previous competiton. This ws a huge learning curve for our members as many people had no idea what was going on. We managed to pass tech and complete Acceleration and Skidpad for the first time. We also did Autocross again. Durign Autocross, our rear wing broke and we were going to do endurance without it and take the penalty of competing without it even though we passed tech with it and needed to compete with it. We werenâ€™t able to do endurance because our chain broke. RIP Our business team also managed to place #1 amoung Texas schools for the business presentation and #16 amoung all teams. We finished with 225.6 points which was a 10% increase in points.`,

        description: `In 2021, we found developing the car to be an extremely challenging endeavor. Due to the still significant presence of Covid in the country, we did not receive approval to manufacture our vehicle until a month before the competition. Furthermore, we suffered to gain and retain members as our only way to promote the team at the time was virtually, which was not an effective method. It also became difficult to motivate people to learn about the car and the skills needed to build one in an online environment. Then during the competition, we were limited in the number of members we could bring, leaving us with only ten members. Unfortunately, things did not improve. Despite getting a car into the competition, its half shaft popped out, and we could not fix it properly, causing it to break in the middle of endurance. Fortunately, some good did come out of all of the struggles.We were able to compete in and complete autocross for the first time and we still able to improve our score with a 13.7% increase in points`,

        description: `In 2019, we utilized our four years of accumulated knowledge and development with our 2018 competition vehicle and managed to build our 2019 vehicle, Voyager, in only one year. Then during the competition, we entered our car into the 22km endurance race, the only dynamic event remaining at the time. Completing the endurance race as a second-year team was unheard of, as countless teams would not have possessed the process to make their vehicles last long enough to complete it. However, despite these obstacles, our car was able to handle the strain, and we managed to complete the whole thing. Ultimately, we finished the competition with a 20.7% increase in effectiveness, a significant improvement from the previous year.`,

Then after four years of making up for our lack of structure, knowledge, and sponsors, we finished developing our first car, Halley's Comet. In Lincoln 2018, we passed the technical inspection and competed in the static events for the first time.`,
