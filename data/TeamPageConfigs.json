Strict FSAE rules must be followed to ensure a properly designed frame will protect the driver at all times. This being the case, there continue to be endless design possibilities that allow young engineers to design a chassis that can take a vehicles performance to its fullest extent. An understanding of vehicle dynamics, manufacturing, driver ergonomics, and integration of other vehicle subsystems is needed to successfully build a chassis. For this reason, members with diverse set skills and passion to learn is required. ",
